Issue: 
Planned to deploy this app in streamlit community cloud cloud
Had an issue while deploying the app in streamlit community (deserilaization with model.h5), Streamlit cloud has Keras==3.6.0 version and the model.h5
is built and saved with keras:==3.5.0. Solved this by updating keras to 3.6 in my local venv and saved the model.h5.

work on regression streamlit app - having some data issue while inputting the data
